Given a string s which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, return the length of the longest palindrome that can be built with those letters.

Letters are case sensitive, for example, "Aa" is not considered a palindrome here.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abccccdd"
Output: 7
Explanation: One longest palindrome that can be built is "dccaccd", whose length is 7.
Example 2:

Input: s = "a"
Output: 1
Explanation: The longest palindrome that can be built is "a", whose length is 1.
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 2000
s consists of lowercase and/or uppercase English letters only.

Approach #1: Greedy [Accepted]
Intuition

A palindrome consists of letters with equal partners, plus possibly a unique center (without a partner). The letter i from the left has its partner i from the right. For example in 'abcba', 'aa' and 'bb' are partners, and 'c' is a unique center.

Imagine we built our palindrome. It consists of as many partnered letters as possible, plus a unique center if possible. This motivates a greedy approach.

Algorithm

For each letter, say it occurs v times. We know we have v // 2 * 2 letters that can be partnered for sure. For example, if we have 'aaaaa', then we could have 'aaaa' partnered, which is 5 // 2 * 2 = 4 letters partnered.

At the end, if there was any v % 2 == 1, then that letter could have been a unique center. Otherwise, every letter was partnered. To perform this check, we will check for v % 2 == 1 and ans % 2 == 0, the latter meaning we haven't yet added a unique center to the answer.


Complexity Analysis

Time Complexity: O(N)O(N), where NN is the length of s. We need to count each letter.

Space Complexity: O(1)O(1), the space for our count, as the alphabet size of s is fixed. We should also consider that in a bit complexity model, technically we need O(\log N)O(logN) bits to store the count values.

## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
